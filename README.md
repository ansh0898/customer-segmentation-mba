Project Title
Customer Segmentation & Market Basket Analysis for Revenue Optimization


Project Objective

The objective of this project was to:

Segment customers based on purchasing behavior using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis

Identify product purchase patterns using Market Basket Analysis (MBA)

Create segment-specific recommendation strategies

Design a validation framework to measure business impact

The goal was not just analysis — but to convert insights into actionable business decisions.


What I Did
step 1: RFM Segmentation

I calculated:

Recency → How recently a customer purchased

Frequency → How often they purchased

Monetary → How much they spent

Customers were segmented into:

Champions

Loyal Customers

New Customers

At Risk

Lost

This allowed personalized strategy instead of one generic approach.

Step 2: Segment-wise KPI Analysis

For each segment, I calculated business KPIs such as:

Revenue per customer

Average Basket Value (ABV)

Repeat purchase rate

Retention rate

Reactivation rate

This helped understand which segments generate the most value and which need intervention.

Step 3: Market Basket Analysis (MBA)

I analyzed product co-purchase behavior to identify:

Frequently bought product pairs

Segment-specific product combinations

Cross-sell and upsell opportunities

Instead of one global rule set, MBA was analyzed per segment to increase personalization.


Key Findings
Champions and Loyal customers have higher basket value and stronger cross-sell potential.

New Customers need encouragement for second purchase.

At-Risk customers show lower repeat rate and need reactivation strategies.

Certain product combinations consistently occur together, creating bundling opportunities.


Recommendation Strategy
Online (E-commerce):

Cart recommendations

“Customers also bought” section

Checkout add-ons

Personalized segment-based offers

 Offline (Retail Store):

Shelf adjacency (placing related products together)

Product placement optimization

Combo offers and bundle discounts

End-cap promotions

Different strategies were proposed for each segment:

Champions → Upsell & premium bundling

Loyal → Cross-sell bundles

New Customers → Encourage repeat purchase

At Risk → Retention & reactivation offers


KPI Mapping:
Segment Focus KPI

Champions = Revenue per customer, ABV, Upsell success

Loyal = Repeat rate, Basket value

New Customers = Conversion rate, First repeat purchase

At Risk = Retention rate, Reactivation rate

Lost = Win-back conversion


Validation Plan

To validate results, I proposed:

A/B Testing

Control group → No recommendations

Test group → MBA-based recommendations

Compare performance

Before vs After Analysis

Track KPIs before implementation and after implementation.

KPIs to Monitor:

Average Basket Value (ABV)

Attach Rate

Conversion Rate

Retention Rate

Reactivation Rate

This ensures measurable business impact.

Business Value

This project delivers:

Personalized marketing strategy

Increased cross-selling opportunities

Higher basket value

Improved customer retention

Revenue optimization through segmentation

It bridges the gap between data analysis and practical business application.

Final Conclusion
This project demonstrates how combining RFM segmentation with Market Basket Analysis creates a powerful framework for targeted recommendations and revenue growth.

Instead of applying one universal strategy, the analysis enables segment-driven decision-making, ensuring that each customer group receives the most effective intervention.

The outcome is a scalable and data-driven approach to improve revenue, retention, and overall customer lifetime value.
